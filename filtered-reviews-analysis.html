            Why would anyone want to create an account when you do not know if
            you want to keep the app? You have not seen the application at work.
            I am a consultant, however, if you understand basic knowledge you
            will agree with my statement. Unfortunately, the author of the
            product did not ask themselves this reasonable question. As a
            result, all of that good work is not realized by the public.

            I was giving Calm five stars till recently when I could not finish
            my sleep story like Humphrey on Rio.. I got the first five minutes
            and it went back and started over. This has happened the last couple
            days even on other sleep stories.

            Just started using it since I got a code for Christmas. Constantly
            has weird sound artifacts when listening to meditations. Difficult
            to navigate and find topics, and most of the topics I found feel
            commercial or have very short meditations. Also, no ability to
            change the speed of the meditation, sometimes I just wanna listen at
            1.25x speed because these people speak so slowly. Prefer Headspace
            over this by leaps and bounds so far

            I expected a directed program to follow, in order to slow my brain,

            Became disappointed with it. I have free version for years and one
            of my favorite features is the daily resets and how clicking on each
            day's message would bring it up on a separate screen so I would take
            a screenshot saved to my photos. They seem to have discontinued that
            because for quite some time now, when I click on the daily reset, it
            brings up the home page of the whole Calm app. I can only pull the
            reset down from my phone's notifications to take a
            screenshot.Update:works intermittently.

            In the middle of the night when I needed help getting back to sleep,
            instead of giving me easy, no-stress ways to do this, they took over
            the screen with questions about why I was awake and page-blockers to
            set up bedtime notifications. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!???? Rather than
            easily going back to sleep to a soothing sleep story, I was so
            distracted and this was so high cognitive load that I was completely
            awake now and it destroyed my whole night's sleep. TERRIBLE APP!

            I like the different options to listen to for learning healthy
            habits. However, if I paused it partway and came back after 5 min, I
            needed to restart the speaker. Sometimes, I had to completely close
            the app before I could come back to listen. I also liked the option
            to listen to soft music to go to sleep and set a timer for it to

            Up until last week this was a great app. Now whenever I get the
            notifications for my check in or the daily calm quote and I click to
            open the app the only thing there is an offer for a discounted plan
            (which I cannot afford so I use the free version) and then a page of
            things that are locked. No thanks, I am done trying to use this any
            longer.

            This really makes me sad but I just can't use it anymore. The voices
            make horrible sounds throughout each meditation. It's almost like
            listening to a scratched record or CD. The voice will slow down or
            repeat with a static like sound. I used to look forward to my daily
            routine of waking up and playing the daily meditations. But now I
            dread it. I still love the content and message of each meditation, I
            just wish the playback quality was better or could be fixed.

            I am sorry but so far I am not impressed. The speakers are often
            overridden by the background sounds that often sound static in
            nature. I like Matt McChaunhy readings. The dashboard a bit
            confusing. Wish it had xome with an introductory video. I am
            surprised as you see it advertised alot.

            In my experience, calm seems to be running deceptive ads. I
            subscribed to have access to supposedly new emdr programs and all I
            could find were subpar sound beats. I've found better free content
            on YouTube. I also feel that the app has overused celebrities. My
            idea of meditation does not include Camilla cabello (no hate, I love
            her music). Overall I was extremely disappointed with the content on
            Calm but mostly upset about the deceptive advertising.

            word but mine is "nostril". this set up is phenomenal and has helped
            me in ways I can't tell you BUT I can't hear nostril 6 times per
            session. I'm at a loss because AS PETTY AS IT IS, that will stop me
            from renewing. I am actually calmer DRIVING, BUT I can't contain my
            irritation with nostril (yes I see the irony here) . Tamara is the
            one that has to continue saying it and SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I can

            It's ok. I was given a code for 3 free months, but nowhere to put it
            in when signing up, so I am just using the free version-- which
            means I see all kinds of options that are not available to me, which
            is frustrating & does not lead to the result I hope for by using
            this app. i've sent an email but have not heard anything back a few
            days later...

            I used to love this app. but lately all of the sleep stories have
            music and it is so hard to fall asleep to that. :( and the voices
            are not as soothing quiet slow and relaxing as they used to be. I
            love tamera Lovetts voice (sorry if i mispelled). its also not the
            most user friendly anymore. Hopefully changes soon because I want to
            love it! make it relaxing again please. <3

            After signing up for Premium and getting a free guest pass offer for
            a "loved one" on my account for 30 days I sent the link to my
            husband who tried to access but had to create a new account of his
            own to claim free pass which then required him to put in his credit
            details which he didnt want to do. The whole process was not
            calming. Calm need to do better if they genuinely want to attract
            new customers. My husband was genuinely keen but now turned off by
            the process and deception.

            Meditations are too short I used LOVE this app for meditation.
            Actually, I think I paid annually for over 5 years but I'm done with
            it. The meditations have shifted towards very short lengths to the
            point that I can't find any new ones more than 10 minutes long. When
            I meditate, I'm trying to escape the fast pace of everyday life not
            embrace it by meditating for 30 seconds...

            The app design is good. The selection is quite good too. I would
            appreciate more traditional meditation practices and courses. Also,
            it's very glitchy. The audio is extremely choppy many times,
            completely ruining the experience.

            Terribly organized. Tons of content but impossible to find anything
            you actually want. They have some good content but the process of
            actually finding what you want among all the irrelevant options is
            so frustrating that it defeats the point of trying to use the app to
            calm yourself. If I didn't get a free membership through an
            organization I am affiliated with I would have deleted the app long
            ago. This here is a call to the developers to fix the organizational
            issues.

            This app is a cluttered mess compared to Headspace. The choices and
            lack of organization are overwhelming. The app is also glitchy with
            it often telling me I haven't completed any meditations yet when I
            have, It's hard to pick up where you left off in a series because it
            doesn't present the next session when you open the app, instead you
            have to dig through an insane amount of content to find the series
            you started. The Calm app actually stresses me out and I regret the
            year-long membership.

            it was good, I used it for many years, especially the "on the go", I
            don't have much time to meditate . now I can't find this on the
            menu, just a lot of huge meditations and none of what I wanted to
            hear. As I said, it was good, now it's not intuitive anymore or
